an experiment in whatever the opposite of "encapsulation" is, in the same vein as dynamicland

i think it would be interesting to see a system where you can affect the state of EVERY object in the system with just one call, my hypothesis is that this would be good in an interactive, multiplayer system, but i need to mess with it more.

if you want to try it, clone and run `npm install -g parcel && npm install` then `parcel index.html`, then go to [localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) to see the demo. the actual app lives in `app.ts`, everything else is fluff

todo:

- [ ] make 'wishes' concept explicit
- [ ] multiplayer w/websockets
